# Smartclock

An Android application imitating a real world punch clock.
When in proximity of an associated Bluetooth low energy beacon, a possibility to punch in will be provided.
After punching in, a chronometer will start tracking work time.

This is a final educational assigment, chosen in collaboration with Smartplan.
